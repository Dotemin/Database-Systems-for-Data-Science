# Aggregation Queries

In this assignment, you will make queries from shared databases:
1. Sakila database: `shared_sakila`
2. Sales database: `shared_sales`
4. Airport database: `shared_airport`

Write all queries in SQL. Use `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements to understand the schema.
The queries may be simple single-table `SELECT` statements, `SELECT` statements with subqueries, or queries with inner joins, or queries with left joins and GROUP BY.
