# Database-Systems-for-Data-Science (Fall 2021)
**MS Applied Data Science**

**Instructor:** Dimitri Yatsenko, Ph.D.

**TA:** Cinni Patel

## Syllabus

Organization concepts and terminology of data models and the underlying data architectures needed to support them. 
Presentation of the relational database management systems including an introduction to SQL programming: relational database design and data queries with integration into application programming languages, with Python used for examples. 

I will assume basic Python proficiency: we want to use databases directly from Python. 

The course will include practical exercises and will be graded based on several indvidual and group projects using real-world datasets.

## Class and attendance

Class participation is required and much of the material will be presented. The class will be held in room SHP 251 and also broadcast in Zoom.
We will also use a Slack channel. If you have not received access to any of these resources, please notify your instructor.
