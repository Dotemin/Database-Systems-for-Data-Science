# Database-Systems-for-Data-Science (Fall 2019)
**MS Applied Data Science**

**Room SHP 146**

**Instructor:** Dimitri Yatsenko (yatsend@stthom.edu)

## Syllabus


Organization concepts and terminology of data models and the underlying data architectures needed to support them. 
Presentation of the relational database management systems including an introduction to SQL programming: relational database design and data queries with integration into application programming languages, with Python used for examples. 

The course will include practical exercises and will be graded based on a few indvidual and group projects on real-world datasets.

**Textbook:** None required. Multiple sources will be used for the course and all matrials and references will be provided in the lectures.

### Weeks 1-2: (Aug 20, 27)
Databases in data science. Data models: diverse ways to think about data: hiearchical, network, relational, object, graph, and document data models.
History of datatabases and database technologies. Next-generation databases.

A Taste of SQL: Database access. Creating SQL tables and inserting data. Simple queries.

### Week 3. (Sep 3) - No class

### Weeks 4-6 (Sep 10, 17, 24)
Querying databases from a host programming language for data analysis (Python).
Client interfaces.
Work with individual tables: `CREATE`/`DROP` `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, and `SELECT` statements.

**Assignment 1:**
You are welcome to use any SQL client to connect to the database as discussed in class. I recommend using Jupyter for ease of interaction.
