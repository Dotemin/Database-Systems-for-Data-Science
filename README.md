**MS Applied Data Science**

**Room SHP 146**

## Syllabus


Organization concepts and terminology of data models and the underlying data architectures needed to support them. 
Presentation of the relational database management systems including an introduction to SQL programming: relational database design and data queries with integration into application programming languages, with Python used for examples. 

The course will include practical exercises and will be graded based on a few indvidual and group projects on real-world datasets.
