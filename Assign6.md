# Queries with inner joins

In this assignment, you will make queries from shared databases:

1. Sakila database `shared_sakila`
2. Sales database: `shared_sales`

Write all queries in SQL. Use `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements to understand the schema.

The queries may be simple single-table `SELECT` statements, `SELECT` statements with subqueries, or queries with inner joins.

Some queries will require `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses but will NOT  require aggregation operators such as `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.

The queries will NOT require outer joins or `GROUP BY` clauses.
